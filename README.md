C++ is many things. Many of them good, many bad. I picked C++ because i like it, and i have a lot of experience with it.

I was bored.

> Why should I use odus?

Sudo tries to do a lot of things. Odus does not.
Therefore, the attack surface is smaller, and (in theory) this leads to less vulnerabilities.
